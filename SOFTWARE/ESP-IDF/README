# esp32-c5-evb-blinking-LED - esp-idf project
# After power-on the user led flashes 3 times, then blinks every second

# How to build the project:

# 2. Install esp-idf (do this one time only)
# 2.1 Go to esp-idf dir:

# 3.2 Execute the following command as it is, including the . symbol
. ./export.sh

# 3.3 go to the project directory
cd PATH/esp32-c5-evb-blinking-LED

# 4. Set target to esp32-c5 (one time only)

idf.py set-target esp32c5

# OPTIONAL: Change  sdkconfig  settings

idf.py menuconfig

# Build:

If everything is done after uploading the project, the led will flash 3 times, then blink every second.
